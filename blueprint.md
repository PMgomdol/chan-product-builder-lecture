# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

A web application that allows users to generate random lottery numbers. The application will be visually engaging, easy to use, and responsive, providing a delightful user experience.

## Style, Design, and Features

### Implemented

*   **Initial Project Setup:**
    *   `index.html`: Main HTML structure.
    *   `style.css`: For all styling.
    *   `main.js`: For application logic.

### Current Plan

1.  **Modern Aesthetics & Layout:**
    *   Apply a clean and modern design with a visually balanced layout, proper spacing, and a subtle background texture for a premium feel.
    *   The main content will be centered in a "card" with soft, deep drop shadows to make it appear lifted.

2.  **Typography and Color:**
    *   Use expressive and clear typography to create a visual hierarchy (main title, generated numbers).
    *   Employ a vibrant color palette. The generated numbers will be displayed in colored circles, resembling lottery balls.

3.  **Interactive Elements:**
    *   A prominent "Generate Numbers" button with a "glow" effect on interaction.
    *   The generated numbers will have a subtle animation upon appearing.

4.  **Functionality:**
    *   Clicking the button will generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
    *   The numbers will be sorted and displayed in ascending order.
    *   The interface will be cleared and updated with the new set of numbers on each generation.

5.  **Responsiveness & Accessibility:**
    *   Ensure the application is fully responsive and works on both mobile and desktop screens.
    *   Use semantic HTML and ensure good color contrast for accessibility.

## Plan for Current Request

1.  **Update `index.html`:** Set up the main structure with a title, a container for the lottery balls, and a generation button.
2.  **Update `style.css`:** Implement the full visual design, including the background, card layout, typography, button styles, and the appearance of the lottery balls.
3.  **Update `main.js`:** Write the JavaScript logic to handle button clicks, generate unique random numbers, sort them, and dynamically create and display the number balls in the UI.
